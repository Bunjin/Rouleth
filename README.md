  Stake : Variable, check on website for the max bet.
  At launch the max stake is 0.05 ETH

  How to play ?
  1) Simplest (via transactions from your wallet, not an exchange) : 
  Just send money to the contract.
  This will by default place a bet on number 7
  Wait 2 minutes (6 blocks) and send 1 wei (or any amount, it will be refunded)
  This will spin the wheel and you will receive * 35 your bet if you win.
  Don't wait more than 200 blocks before you spin the wheel or your bet will expire.

  2) Advanced (via contract functions, e.g. Mist, cf. tutorial on my website for more details) :
  Import the contract in Mist wallet using the code of the ABI (link on my website)
  Use the functions (betOnNumber, betOnColor ...) to place any type of bet you want
  Provide the appropriate input (ex: check box Red or Black)
  add the amount you want to bet.
  wait 6 blocks, then use the function spinTheWheel, this will solve the bet.
  You can only place one bet at a time
  Don't wait more than 200 blocks before you spin the wheel or your bet will expire.



  Use the website to track your bets and the results of the spins


   How to invest ?
   Import the contract in Mist Wallet using the code of the ABI (link on my website)
   Use the Invest function with an amount >10 Ether (can change, check on my website)
   You will become an investor and share the profits and losses of the roulette
   proportionally to your investment. There is a 2% fee on investment to help with the server/website
   cost and also 2% on profit that go to the developper.
   The rest of your investment goes directly to the payroll and 98% of profits are shared between 
   investors relatively to their share of total. Losses are split similarly.
   You can withdraw your funds at any time after the initial lock period (set to 1 week)
   To withdraw use the function withdraw and specify the amoutn you want to withdraw in Wei.
   If your withdraw brings your investment under 10 eth (the min invest, subject to change)
   then you will execute a full withdraw and stop being an investor.
   
   
   At start there is a limit of 50 investors (can be maxed to 150)
   If there is not open position and you want to invest, you can try to buyout a current investor.
   To buyout, you have to invest more than any investor whose funds are unlocked (after  1 week grace lock period)

   At any time an investor can add funds to his investment with the withdraw function.
   Doing so will refresh the lock period and secure your position.
